You must have at least three controllers (Think python functions with @app.route decorators)
- index with listings (base.html, with all the page design)
- listing page
- user profiles

You must have at least three views (Think templates)
- make template for each controller

Your app should have user session management. (anything to do with session management does not
count for the above controller/view requirement or the below database requirements) I recommend you
look at the Flask-Login plugin.
- Login system page

You must use records or SqlAlchemy and create a database with 3-4 tables. These tables should
incorporate a one to many relationship in some way, or they may have a many to many relationship
These tables do not include any tables that you create for user management.
- Table for listings
- Table for users and their listings

You should incorporate the WTForms module into your application for processing form data. -- You can
teach yourself this from the tutorial.
- Forms for posting a listing
- Maybe search form

You must make use of at least 1 web API for some aspect of the project that you use in your web pages.
Or you may define your own API for your app to use on one or more of the pages.
- API endpoint for listings
- Use Vue to display returned data

Your program must use the bootstrap templates, and you must make an attempt to make it look aesthetically nice.
- Use bootstrap
